<p>This tool is developed to fit Bayesian Knowledge Training models efficiently on large datasets. It is a command line utility written in C/C++. The project started while the author was a post-doc at Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. These sources are published under BSD-new (3-clause BSD) license.</p>

<p>BKT is a user modeling approach in wide use in the area of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. The goal of BKT is to infer whether the student has mastered a skill or not from a pattern of successful or unsuccessful attempts to apply the skill. It is a special case of Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In BKT there are two types of nodes: binary state nodes capture skill mastery (mastered or not) and binary observation nodes (correct or incorrect application of a skill). </p>

<p>For each skill BKT has four parameters.</p>

<ol>
<li>pInit or pLo - is a probability the skill was known a priori,</li>
<li>pLearn or pT - is a probability the skill will transition into <em>mastered</em> state upon practice attempt,</li>
<li>pForget or pF - is a probability that the skill will transition into <em>not mastered state</em> upon practice attempt. Traditionally, pForget is set to zero.</li>
<li>pSlip or pS - is a probability that a known skill is applied incorrectly, and</li>
<li>pGuess or pG - is a probability that unknown skill will be applied correctly.</li>
</ol>

<p>Parameters of the BKT can be represented in the matrix form. Priors -- <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cpi" alt="\pi"> -- are a vector 1*N, where N is the number of states. Throughout this discussion, we will we assume that the first element of the <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cpi" alt="\pi"> vector is the a priory probability of knowing the skill. pLearn is part of the transitions matrix A that captures probabilities of state changes from row to column and is N*N. No forgetting is captured by setting A[1,2] = 0 (from mastered to unmastered). pLearn corresponds to A[2,1] - from unmastered to mastered. pGuess and pSlip are specified in B -- observation matrix N*M, where M is the number of observations. First column corresponds to correct observation, second -- incorrect. For two observations, typical for BKT, pGuess is B[2,1] -- unmastered skill but a correct response, and pSlip is B[1,2] - mastered skill but incorrect response. </p>

<p>For more details on BKT refer to (Corbett &amp; Anderson, 1995)[^1]. (Levinson et al., 1983 )[2], among other things, discusses how a gradient-based fitting of HMM can be implemented. [3][3] and [4][4] cover additional topics relevant for the implementation.</p>

<a id="getting-and-compiling-the-code" class="anchor" href="#getting-and-compiling-the-code" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting and Compiling the Code</h1>

<p>Open version of the code is available via International Educational Data Mining Society GitHub <a href="http://goo.gl/5DqpkW">repository</a>. If you have git tool installed, use the following command to get the source code.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>git clone https://github.com/IEDMS/standard-bkt</pre></div>

<p>To compile issue <code>make all</code> command. If you are on Linux, the <code>g++/gcc</code> compiler and Open MP library should already be installed. In Mac OX, you would need command line tools of Xcode to be installed. <code>g++/gcc</code> compiler with Open MP (no longer bundled with Mac OS X by default) could be downloaded from <a href="http://hpc.sourceforge.net">hpc.sourceforge.net</a>. If you are on Windows, you might need to install cygwin and have <code>g++/gcc</code> compiler available and be sure to install <code>make</code> command with <code>cygwin</code>.</p>

<h1>
<a id="data" class="anchor" href="#data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data</h1>

<p>Input file data format is quite simple. Four tab separated columns: observation, student, problem/problem step, skill(s). Observation is a 1-started integer. For the two-state BKT, we advise to use 1 for <em>correct</em> and 2 for <em>incorrect</em>. Student is a string label, so is problem or problem step, whatever granularity you prefer. Skill is a string label. Multiple skill labels should be delimited by a character of your choice (do not use tab). An example of few lines of input is below where tilde symbol <code>~</code> is used as delimiter. </p>

<pre><code>-- input file --
2   student_001 unit1-section1-problem5-step1  addition~multiplication
1   student_001 unit1-section1-problem5-step2  multiplication
1   student_001 unit1-section1-problem5-step3  addition
-- input file --
</code></pre>

<p>If there is no skill label for a particular row of data use <code>.</code> (dot) symbol. In test data, the utility will use known observations for training and will produce predictions for missing observations that should have <code>.</code> (dot) instead of observation code (1, 2, or otherwise).</p>

<p>Output files are the model and the predictions file. Model file contains general information about the data, e.g., number of observations, number of skills and number of problems/problem steps; as well as the model parameters.</p>

<p>Prediction file consists of model predictions for each row of the input file. Depending on the option (see parameter specifications below), you can print out probability distribution for student's response (probability of correct and probability of incorrect, if the observation node is binary) and, additionally, print out probability distributions over the values of the hidden state for all skills specified for the data point. The probability values are tab separated. See examples of a outputs file below. </p>

<pre><code>-- model file --
SolverId    1.1
nK  1
nG  1
nS  2
nO  2
Null skill ratios     1.0000000   0.0000000
0   multiplication-skill
PI  0.45000000  0.55000000
A   1.00000000  0.00000000  0.40000000  0.60000000
B   0.79000000  0.21000000  0.22000000  0.78000000
-- model file --
</code></pre>

<p>In the model file example above, we see a specification of the solver algorithm (to be discussed below), one skill (nK=1), one student in the data (nG=1), two hidden states and 2 observations (nS and nO respectively). Skill numbering is zero started. Skill name is "multiplication-skill". Rows prefixed with PI, A, and B correspond to priors, transition, and observation matrices written row by row. Thus, first element of PI is pLo=0.55, 3rd element of A is pT=0.4, 2nd and 3rd elements of B are pS=0.12 and pG=0.22 respectively.</p>

<p><code>trainhmm</code> utility has the following launch signature:</p>

<pre><code>trainhmm [options] input_file [[model_file] prediction_file]
options:
-s : structure.solver[.solver setting], structures: 1-by skill, 2-by user;
     solvers: 1-Baum-Welch, 2-Gradient Descent, 3-Conjugate Gradient Descent;
     Conjugate Gradient Descent has 3 settings: 1-Polak-Ribiere,
     2-Fletcherâ€“Reeves, 3-Hestenes-Stiefel, and 4-Dai-Yuan.
     For example '-s 1.3.1' would be by skill structure (classical) with
     Conjugate Gradient Descent and Hestenes-Stiefel formula, '-s 2.1' would be
     by student structure fit using Baum-Welch method.
-S : perform scaling of forward/backward variables: 0 - off (default), 1 - on.
     Only allowed for Baum-Welch solver ('-s 1.1' setting), otherwise auto-set
     to off.
-e : tolerance of termination criterion (0.01 for parameter change default);
     could be computed by the change in log-likelihood per datapoint, e.g.
    '-e 0.00001,l'.
-i : maximum number of iterations (200 by default)
-q : quiet mode, without output, 0-no (default), or 1-yes
-n : number of hidden states, should be 2 or more (default 2)
-0 : initial parameters comma-separated for priors, transition, and emission
     probabilities skipping the last value from each vector (matrix row) since
     they should sum up to 1; default 0.5,1.0,0.4,0.8,0.2
-l : lower boundaries for parameters, comma-separated for priors, transition,
     and emission probabilities (without skips); default 0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
-u : upper boundaries for params, comma-separated for priors, transition,
     and emission probabilities (without skips); default 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.3,0.3,1
     with slip and guess capped at 0.3.
-c : specification of the C weight and centroids for L2 penalty, empty (default).
     For standard BKT - 4 comma-separated numbers: C weight of the penalty and
     centroids, for PI, A, and B matrices respectively. If used for iBKT with
     student effects, 8 values will be used with 4 additional values for student
     effect matrices. For example, '-c 1.0,0.5,0.5,0.0'.
-f : fit as one skill, 0-no (default), 1 - fit as one skill and use params as
     starting point for multi-skill, 2 - force one skill
-m : report model fitting metrics (AIC, BIC, RMSE) 0-no (default), 1-yes. To 
     specify observation for which metrics to be reported, list it after ','.
     For example '-m 0', '-m 1' (by default, observation 1 is assumed), '-m 1,2'
     (compute metrics for observation 2). Incompatible with '-v' option.
-v : cross-validation folds, stratification, and target state to validate
     against, folds input/output file, default 0 (no cross-validation),
     examples '-v 5,i,2' - 5 fold, item-stratified c.-v., predict state 2,
     '-v 10' - 10-fold subject-stratified c.-v. predict state 1 by default,
     alternatively '-v 10,g,1', '-v 5,n,2,folds.txt,o' - 5-fold unstratified
     c.-v. predicting state 2, [o]output folds to 'folds.txt', and here 
     '-v 5,n,2,folds.txt,i', folds are actually read [i]n from the file.
-p : report model predictions on the train set 0-no (default), 1-yes; 2-yes,
     plus output state probability; works with -v and -m parameters.
-U : controls how update to the probability distribution of the states is
     updated. Takes the following format '-U r|g[,t|g]', where first
     character controls how prediction treats known observations, second -- how
     prediction treats unknown observations, and third -- whether to output
     probabilities of priors. Dealing with known observations 'r' - reveal
     actual observations for the update of state probability distribution (makes
     sense for modeling how an actual system would work), 'g' - 'guessing' the
     observation based on the predicted outcomes (arg max) -- more appropriate
     when comparing models (so that no information about observation is never
     revealed). Dealing with unknown observations (marked as '.' -- dot): 't' --
     use transition matrix only, 'g' -- 'guess' the observation.
     Default (if ommitted) is '-U r,t'.
     For examle, '-U g,g would require 'guessing' of what the observation was
     using model parameters and the running value of the probabilities of state
     distributions.
-d : delimiter for multiple skills per observation; single skill per observation
     (default), otherwise -- delimiter character, e.g. '-d ~'.
-b : treat input file as binary input file created from text file by
     inputconvert utility.
-B : block re-estimation of prior, transitions, or emissions parameters
     respectively (default is '-B 0,0,0'), to block re-estimation of transition
     probabilities specify '-B 0,1,0'.
-P : use parallel processing, default - 0 (no parallel processing), 1 - fit
     separate skills/students separately, 2 - fit separate sequences within
     skill/student separately.
-o : in addition to printing to console, print output to the file specified
     default is empty.

<p>Small sample data file  is generated using the following BKT parameters: pLo=0.4, pT=0.35, pS=0.25, pG=0.12. </p>

<p>To fit a BKT model of this data using an EM algorithm run the following command:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>./trainhmm -s 1.1 -m 1 -p 1 toy_data.txt model.txt predict.txt</pre></div>

<p>The model will have 90% accuracy and root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.302691 and the recovered BKT parameters would be: pLo=0.00000000, pT=0.16676161, pS=0.00044059, pG=0.00038573. Overall loglikelihood, actually, goes up from 9.3763477 to 10.4379501 in 3 iterations.</p>

<p>If we fit BKT model using Gradient Descent method using <code>-s 1.2</code> argument, the recovered parameters would be: pLo=0.00041944, pT=0.17478539, pS=0.07938036, 0.03804388, the accuracy would remain at 90% while RMSE = 0.299250. Loglikelihood changes from  9.3763477 to 6.4099682 after 11 iterations.</p>

<p>To generate predictions using a previously fit model run the following command  (do not forget that prediction will only be generated for rows where observation is not known -- marked with <code>.</code>): </p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>./predicthmm -p 1 toy_data_test.txt model.txt predict.txt</pre></div>

<p>To give this tool a proper test you might want to try it on a KDD Cup 2010 dataset donated to the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center by Carnegie Learning Inc. The dataset can be downloaded (after a quick registration) from <a href="http://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/KDDCup/">here</a>. This datasets consists of training and challenge sets. For the sake of testing the tool, download the challenge  Algebra I set that has about 9 million transactions of over 3300 students. The training file should be trimmed to the tool's format. See shell commands below that do that.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>gawk -F<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>\t<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>BEGIN{OFS=""} {if(NR==1)next; skill=$20; gsub("~~", "~", skill); skill=(skill=="")?".":($3"__"skill); print 2-$14,$2,$3"__"$4,skill;}<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> algebra_2008_2009_train.txt <span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> a89_kts_train.txt</pre></div>

<p>To fit a BKT model of this dataset using gradient descent method as well as to compute fit metrics and the prediction run the following command:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>./trainhmm -s 1.2 -d <span class="pl-k">~</span> -m 1 -p 1 a89_kts_train.txt model.txt predict.txt</pre></div>

<p>Depending on your hardware, the model should be fit in about 1-2 minutes.</p>
